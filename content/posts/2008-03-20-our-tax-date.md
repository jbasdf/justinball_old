Tonight was the first time since September that I and Callie have been alone, together, outside of the house. We were able to spend 15 minutes eating a Quiznos sub in a gas station in Tremonton, UT. After that we visited our accountant (The best accountant in the world - Michael Bruce in Tremonton) and did our taxes. I know that everyone already knows this, but I am sure my wife will tell you that I am a hopeless romantic.
