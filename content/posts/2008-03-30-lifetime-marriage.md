In church today an older lady stood up and said she was grateful for her marriage of 60 years. I was impressed. I think that the divorce today tends to discourage people from believing that they can spend a lifetime with another person. It seems rare to find a couple that has been together for 60 years not just because of divorce but also because of health. Whenever I see a couple that is celebrating half a century together that accomplishment feels far more significant than all the awards, the academic degrees, or political achievements one can accumulate.
