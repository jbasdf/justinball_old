Sure I am a bit obsessed, but I have been tracking my bike's movements from the Trek factory to the local shop. At 6:07pm it hit Salt Lake City. It should be here tomorrow. Maybe I should take the day off.

In the mean time I have been satiating my bike lust with whatever I can find online. Here are some cool videos:
