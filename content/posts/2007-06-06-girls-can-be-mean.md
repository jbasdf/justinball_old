I have three daughters two are twins. Aubrey is the one that does what she is supposed to. Any time there is a reward system she gets the most of whatever it is. Currently, we are giving stars to the kids and when they fill up a chart they get to do something fun like get ice cream etc. Aubrey's is almost full. Alyssa is lucky to have a couple of stars on hers.

So the other night I come down stairs. Aubrey, having just taken care of her dishes and finished putting her pajamas on received a couple more stars.

Alyssa was bawling. It was very sad, but I still laugh. "I am always bad. I don't even know how to be good, " Alyssa was throwing a tantrum. Aubrey in the mean time sat on her bed mocking her sister saying, "bla bla bla bla, bla bla bla bla" over and over again whilst Alyssa is in a very dramatic moment of depression.

The humor is that they take such great pleasure in torturing each other. I guess that is sad too.

I am sitting here now.

Aubrey is getting punished - Callie is taking some of her money away. Alyssa's response? "Good!"

Ouch
