My wife hates it but I love the history channel. Tonight I am learning how they make gelatin. Gross does not even begin to describe the process that starts with 40,000 lbs of cow bones and hydrochloric acid. I can better handle the vinegar process. It starts with 195 proof corn grain alcohol. Move over Jack Daniels and remember no smoking in the plant.
