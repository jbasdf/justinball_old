Today has been fun. We had Indian for lunch. Something about set my mouth on fire. Nearly killed me. During the geek demo hour I met Kevin Mark from Technorati who is one of the key players in the Microformats world. I also went to a session sponsored by [Chris Messina][1] ([factoryjoe][2]) who focused on Microformats and how they relate to Identity.
I had a chance to talk to developers from Sxip and Janrain who helped me understand how OpenID works and pointed me at code.
David Huska, developer from Sxip, told me about [XDI][3] ([XDI home][4]) which let me to the current talk that I am attending which is about [XRI][5] and XDI. ([OASIS subgroup][6]) Andy from [OOTAO][7] is showing an example of [Kintera][8], a non profit services provider, sharing data with Le leche a non profit. XDI is the interface that Le Leche uses to access the Kintera systems. It lets a machine make requests to a remote system kind of like SQL lets an app query a database. Kind of interesting, and useful for large enterprise systems. The example being shown requires that the two parties know each other and setup a complex contract before interactions are allowed to occur. Useful for those that need it, but so far it seems rather heavy for main stream consumption.

I spent a while talking to Devlin from BYU about the new REST stuff in Rails 1.2. He is a Rails genius and I need to spend more time with him.

I came late to the Cardspace session, but it looks pretty cool and [Kim Cameron][9] is an amazing guy. This could be on of the better, more innovative, and useful things to come out of Microsoft in a while. Cardspace could be a really cool way to help normal users play in the advanced Identity space. I think we might borrow his PHP code tonight and see how far we can get on a Ruby library. [Bill Barnes][10], a guy that works with Kim is supposed to be interested in a Ruby library as well.
