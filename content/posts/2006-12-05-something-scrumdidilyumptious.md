Just short of a year ago I hacked together a project that we loving called [scrumdidilyumptio.us][1]. I and Wiley managed to finish it at about 2 in the morning in a hotel in NY during the Mellon meeting. (I actually worked on it during the meeting which resulted in terrible embarsement when my system speaker went off for a few minutes during a talk from MIT because of a misstep in setting up my database.) At any rate [Wiley finally decided to say something about it which is important because people actually read his blog][2]. He has a sweet idea that integrates with 43things. I hope to spend some time working on scrumdidilyumptious when I get back from the Identity Conference. We should be able to get a new release out in a few weeks.
