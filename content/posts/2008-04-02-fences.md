Now that the weather has warmed up a bit around here all of a sudden all my neighbors want to put up fences. I'm not exactly sure what I did, but I must admit that it is a bit disappointing to see. For several years the houses and yards around us have been open. All the kids could freely roam and play with each other in each other's yards.

I think that is about to change. I could be wrong, but to me a fence says this is mine, that is yours, stay the hell out.

I think that businesses build fences. I noticed it today when I was at Albertson's (grocery store). They have a deal that requires you to buy 20 items from a certain list of participating items. I hit the 'fence' after I selected 20 items. I would have added more but wasn't sure if that meant I had to buy another 20 items to get the deal. Since I only wanted 3 or 4 more items not another 20 I stopped at 20. The business failed to communicate and in effect fenced me off from purchasing more items.

Websites have fences as well. It is very easy to make navigation so difficult that some of your content is effectively fenced off from the rest of the website. I frequently feel that way when I browse a site. It feels like there should be more but the virtual walls around me keep me from seeing it.
