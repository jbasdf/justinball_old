I was just reading in the [Deseret News this morning that payday lenders have filed 27,000 lawsuits in the State of Utah since 2005][1].  In the Provo judicial district this account for 81% of the total lawsuits.  It is bad enough that these places prey on the poor with 500% interest loans.  It is yet another of their sins that they use the court system, funded with tax money, as their goons to collect.  Who needs Guido and concrete boots when you can get the same service for free?
