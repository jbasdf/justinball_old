I am frequently asked how reliable/scalable is Ruby on Rails? I usually tell people about [Twitter][1]or more recently point them to [this article about the Friend's For Sale Facebook application][2]. The answer is, yes Rails scales just fine. The trick is getting your database to scale.

Anyway, [Obie Fernandez, a major name in the Rails community put together a list of the big companies that are using Rails][3].

Here are two of the places to look for the big Rails deployments:

<a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/high-profile-organisations">http://www.workingwithrails.com/high-profile-organisations</a>.


The elegant, framework that lets developers enjoy their job once again is scalable and will work for you application. I love Ruby on Rails.
