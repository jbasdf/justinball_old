I ate pickle soup. It was awesome. Try new things you might be surprised.

Evolution is bullshit. If it were real mankind would have evolved such that his hair did not migrate from the top of his head to his back, ears and nose as he grows older.

I bought more cereal today. 13 boxes to be exact. I like to push my luck. I hadn't realized just how much cereal we have. I think we number somewhere in the 100 boxes range. If there is ever an apocalypse our kids be happy because they will think life has become one eternal saturday morning.

Devin is taking more steps each day.
