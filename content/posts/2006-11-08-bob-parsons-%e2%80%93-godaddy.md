Focus on advertising that is edgy and different if not offensive. Their super bowl ad was rejected but then viewed on the Internet by far more people than the one on TV. He bought two ads. The first one showed and offended someone. The second ad was pulled. The controversy resulted in a giant increase in business. The ad is now used as an example of one of the most successful ads in the history of advertising.
