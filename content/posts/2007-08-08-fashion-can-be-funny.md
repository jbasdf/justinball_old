I have noticed a lot of women in camouflage pants lately. I think this is the latest fashion or maybe they wear it because they are trying to hide something.

My bet is that there is a group of fashion designers somewhere in New York. They get together and have coffee and laugh, A LOT. I guess the conversion goes something like this:

"So Domenique, you win again. I did not think you could pull off the pancho thing, but that was awesome."

"It was Enrique, and this year I think we should go for the Halloween look. I bet we can get moms to wear what they dressed their boys in last year. Camo anyone?"

Take a look around next time you are shopping and notice that Enrique won that bet.
