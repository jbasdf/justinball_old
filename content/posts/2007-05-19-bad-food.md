I have eaten a lot of bad food over the past few days which is too bad given that Portland has good restaurants. The main source of bad food is the Rails conference.
A WORD TO CONFERENCE ORGANIZERS:
Stale pastry and coffee do not count as breakfast.
Lunch is not much better.
It is so bad that we went to Denny's this morning. I was forced to debug my cereal - some kind of winged ant found its way into my raisin bran. Denny's food is just nasty.

I like Japanese food so we went looking for a Japanese restaurant last night. When we saw the place we kept walking because it looked like it would be crap. Unfortunately, all the other places were full and we were running out of time so we went back. Bad choice. If you are in Portland do not eat at Koji OsaKaya. Their food is total crap.

I have taken to eating granola bars and bananas. Does anyone have a decent recommendation for lunch?

PS a special thanks goes out to [thoughtworks][1] for supplying me with ALOT of granola bars.
