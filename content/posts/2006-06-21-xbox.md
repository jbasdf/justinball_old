I should be writing more but I bought and xbox 360. Stupid thing. I and my wife played Zuma till 1 am last night. I wish fun stuff wasn't so addicting. I have the audio hooked into my reciever with 6.1 surround. It is something to hear. I promise myself to write more code soon and to get to the next level of Zuma.
