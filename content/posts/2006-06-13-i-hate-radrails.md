As per my last post I am loving Ruby on Rails. The biggest drawback to the framwork is my quest to find the right editor.
I have actually been using Dreamweaver when I write code on Windows. It makes me feel like a lesser programmer for some reason,
but it works great. There is a plugin called [RubyWeaver][1] that makes it easy. Add into that the Subversion utility for
Dreamweaver that lets you [cloak/uncloak SCM Directories][2] and you have a decent editor.
(Without that last extension Dreamweaver will try to upload all the hidden Subversion directories and make a mess of you server).

On Linux I have been using [RadRails][3]. It is ok most of the time. However, every now and then it drives me nuts.
Today is such a day. When I copy and paste I get randon 'invalid argument' errors. I can live with that but the latest is insane.
As I type, Radrails is outputing everything in reverse. No kidding. Here is some output:
