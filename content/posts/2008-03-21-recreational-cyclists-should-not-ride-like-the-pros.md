Well sort of. The pros have great techniques. They are fun to watch. You want legs like then and their bikes are awesome. You can learn about how to climb hills and how to sprint from the pros.

However, you shouldn't ride like them because you can't. Any pro team has a hierarchy that most recreational or amature teams do not. Next time you are out riding with your buddies tell Bob he gets to be your domestique. I bet he goes for that. The pros have a team manager in a car with a TV feed and a headset that lets him give intel to the riders. The level of communication is sophisticated and since they are paid each rider better pay attention and do what they are told.

The rest of us ride for fun. We don't usually ride with earpieces. Our level of communication is limited to hand signals and shouting which takes energy that you may not have and only one or two riders can hear you anyway.

Don't feel bad about all this. You could buy some communications gear, but I bet your buddies would rather upgrade their wheels or get some new shorts. You could assign a "team manager" but it will probably be somebodies wife since it is not likely that any of the riders want to sit in a car and watch the other guys have fun. Besides the idea is pretty stupid.

However, if you find yourself riding with the same guys a lot you can train as a team. You can learn to ride in a paceline. A culture will develop that is unique and where the movements of the group are understood by all. If you get good you will be able to ride in a rotating paceline and you will learn to support your fellows when they need it - like when they get a flat. There's no team car so somebody has to stay back and help.
