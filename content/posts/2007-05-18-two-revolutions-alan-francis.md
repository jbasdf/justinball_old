I tried to get into the REST talk but it is so full that they have guys guarding the doors to keep people out. I am instead sitting in an extreme programming session. I wouldn't have come in here except I noticed that DHH walked in. I figure if he sees potential value in this talk then it is likely that I might as well.

The talk turned out to be interesting in that it led to a discussion of revolution of of Frameworks and development philosophies. Historically, frameworks have evolved and been replaced with something new. In their wake however they leave large installations and large numbers of programmers trained in the technology. So I agree that there needs to be change and things need to get better. However, there is a need for responsibility. The success of these frameworks (like Ruby on Rails) depends on widespread adoption. Widespread adoption depends on some assurance that the framework will be around, be scalable, be developed, etc.
