I had to reboot the server in my office closet this evening. That's when I realized that I am a really big nerd. I have a server in my closet with RAID 5 to backup the other computers in the house. I have so many now that I actually have to count them to remember the exact number. Sitting on top of my server I have a rack mount server that is just sitting there. I keep thinking I'll do something with that someday.

The computers are only a small part of the equation. As I rebooted the server I looked around at the stacks of Star Wars Legos. I've collected them for years. I love Star Wars Legos. (I am even geeky enough to know that 'Legos' isn't the actual term and that Lego zealots will throw a fit, but I like the term Legos and this is my blog.

Completing out my geek license is the fact that I have an enormous tub full of cables, circuit boards and electrical components that would put Radio Shack to shame. I pay the outrageous cable prices simply so I can get the next season of Battlestar Gallactica as soon as it comes out. I bought my wife a robot vacuum and mop for Christmas last year. I'm sure she fears what I'll buy this time around.
