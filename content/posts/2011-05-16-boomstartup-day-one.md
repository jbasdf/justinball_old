It's 8pm and we're still here. We're staying the night in SLC so there's really not much reason to leave. If we can just find some showers we might just spend the night....

Our day begins.

Had orientation this morning. Nothing to earth shattering there, but we did have a chance to ask questions of some of the 2010 Boomstartup companies. My takeaway was that they all loved the program, they are still excited and enjoy what they do, and there's still plenty of work left to do.

I know that feeling.

We had a great meeting with our mentor [Robb Kunz][1] this afternoon. He helped poke holes in what we're doing as well as lay the groundwork for our next meetings. I hate meetings, but these are actually productive and informative instead of a big waste of time like most of the meetings of my past. Don't tell him, but Robb is one of the big reasons we joined [BoomStartup][2]. We felt like we needed his expertise and it was worth 6% of the company to get that.

If we're wrong I'll blog about it here.

OER Glue isn't my first company, but it is the first time that we're trying to go big fast and reach a broad audience. I think that's critical given the kind of product that we're building. Right now when we show it to people the typical response is a jaw drop and questions about how we pull off the magic. I think that in addition to building a successful company we can also make a big difference in the education space.

It's a really cool tool.

It had better be a cool tool. I'm sitting in a cube farm. I haven't done that for 10 years and it's not the kind of environment we plan on as we establish our own company, but for now I'll deal with it. We're commuting to Salt Lake every week during which time we'll work every moment we're not asleep. We expect to work like crazy over the next 12 weeks. I just sold a company. I don't have to do this. 

Why bother you ask?

OER Glue will change the way the Internet is used to deliver educational experiences. We've been in the OER and education space for 7 years. We've built a number of projects and learned from all of them. This time it's our own money and time. Find out what makes it magical.
