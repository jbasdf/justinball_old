During the winter I become a little less obsessed with bikes. The fact that the only place I have to ride is in my office on my trainer while it is 19 degrees outside doesn't help. In spite of the winter cycling duldrums I have been looking forward to January 1 for a long time because that is when Trek's Project One was to be updated with the new Madones. It is now the 15th and I am still waiting. (Does anyone else feel like everything related to the new Madones involves waiting?) At any rate I am still looking forward to the launch so that I can spec out a bike that I can't afford to buy.

I hate waiting but I am looking forward to the day when I can max out my credit cards.
