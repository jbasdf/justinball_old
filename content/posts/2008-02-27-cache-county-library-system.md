Right now in Cache County each city has its own library system and citizens of one city are not allowed to checkout books from a library in another city unless they pay for a very expensive library card. This is unfortunate as it creates a barrier to information for those who really need it. By combining resources the libraries will be able to provide a greater number of resources to everyone in the county. There is an initiative to form a county wide library system. [Sign the petition and provide access to all the materials for everyone][1].
