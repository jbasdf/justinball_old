People ask me what I do for a living and I gave up explaining a long time ago. Now I just say I write software and for those that don't understand that I tell them I work with computers. ([No I will not fix yours][1]).

In spite of my general disdain for explaining what I do I am posting explanation anyway because today it is meaningful and interesting.

Currently, I am the Teachers Without Borders Fellow at The Center for Open and Sustainable learning which means that I got to be a part of [this][2]. [Another article here,][3] and something from [CNN Money][4]. Kudos to all the COSL people who helped put together the social networking piece when Fred came for a visit and congratulations to the team in the Middle East who has taken charge of the project, learned how to manage it and worked together in spite of the cultural differences. We were only a small part of this project but it is fun to have had the chance to participate.

When Cisco advertises 'The Human Network' these are the projects they are talking about.
