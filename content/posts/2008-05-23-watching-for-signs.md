I wrote this on May 11th but never got around to posting it:

We took the kids to Thanksgiving Point yesterday to look at the gardens. They had a great time. Whenever we travel through the Salt Lake area it seems that my wife has a $10 coupon for JCPenny
that "would just be silly not to use." The signs were not in our favor and we ended up down a dead end road. We turned around and made our way through some of the darker areas of that part
of town until we saw a lot of cars and chose to follow them. That led us to the store. Who says following the crowd doesn't work? We made it to the mall just before closing.
All the kids needed to use the facilities at that point so at 10 at night we hauled all the kids into the store so they could pee. As we stepped in the front door our quest
was almost over before it started. Right as we walked in the front door there was a sign that said 'Restrooms'. We started walking down the short hall but there were only two doors
and neither looked like a restroom. The arrow pointing towards relief was aimed downward. We assumed that the arrow had been turned somehow and that the restrooms were somewhere close.
We walked through the store and ran into a salesman he haughtily told us, "they are downstairs." I said, "that's good because the sign back there made me wonder if we were supposed to pee on the floor." He was a suite salesman and not amused.
