I sat in a meeting at the university today and listened to a sales pitch by an SEO company. We get calls at [The Plan Collection][1] for these all the time.

I need to setup one of these companies. They are usually run by a couple of jokers who know very little about SEO. In this case the jokers were looking for easy money. They wanted 10k for a 'keyword analysis' and 10k to optimize 10 pages. Holy Crap!

The 'analysis' involved a bunch of people at the university running around coming up with the 'things they want to advertise' - read keywords. Not sure what that leaves for the SEO company to do. I guess they can type it up. Makes them a pretty dang expensive secretary. They then wanted to charge to setup an adwords campaign - you know because Google makes that process so hard.

My tip?

Start with [SEOChat.com][2]. This site is a vibrant community of real SEO pros that will tell you all kinds of neat stuff for free. Work a little and save yourself the tens of thousands of dollars.
