I am not a serious entrepreneur, but I have started up a few companies over the years. One I sold. One we folded and I still run one - [ThePlanCollection.com.][1]

[I ran across this article with startup tips][2]. My favorite tip is 'outsource to middle America'. I would have to say there are a lot of smart people that choose to not live in the startup hot beds because life is cheaper elsewhere. The only disadvantage of living out of the mainstream is that your non-virtual interactions are limited - user group meetings and presentations are harder. Technology is changing that as communities come online. I and my partner rarely meet at all anymore. We do everything over IM. It forces us to focus on what needs to be done rather than spend time shooting the bull.
