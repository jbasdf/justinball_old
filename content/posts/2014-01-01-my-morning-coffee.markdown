Plenty of us working stiffs here in the United States wake up each morning a bit groggy as we prepare for another day as a cog
in the grind. That means <a href="http://www.ico.org/trade_e.asp">coffee is the most widely traded agriculture commodity in the world</a>.
Inject hot air, sugar and fat into coffee and a 25 cent cup of truck stop pick me up becomes a $6 Starbucks masterpiece.
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/05/a-better-way-to-think-about-yo/">Nestle saw an 800% increase in profits with the Nespresso.</a>
It's the same coffee but if you put it in a little cup, make it easy to prepare and add a bit of flavoring the commodity becomes a
luxury. The proof of our love for coffee is the price we pay.

I'm guilty. I pay just as much for my morning pick me up. I drink it every morning. It wakes me up. It keeps me healthy. It powers my rides.

My secret is that I've never drunk coffee, but I do have a 'Mormon' version that I feel fine sharing with my even my youngest kids.

The measurements are estimates. I end up guessing most of the time. Put the ingredients in the blender
in the order below - it will be easier on your blender to grind up the non-frozen stuff first. I buy the frozen blue berries and
cherries at Sams.

<blockquote>
1/4 cup flax seed
1/2 cup of Kefir
1 Banana
2 Handfuls of spinach
1/2 cup frozen blueberries
1/2 cup frozen cherries
Any other random left over fruit
</blockquote>

It should come out quite purple. Drink it fast or it will start to solidify and turns into nasty grossness.
One warning - it's not low calorie but it will wake you up.
