It's not often that the stars align and two big events coincide. Today is Father's day, but it's also our anniversary.

Today is a big deal since it marks 15 years of being married to the most beautiful, kindest, and most wonderful woman on earth. I can't believe that 15 years can go so fast, but I'm planning on at least another 60 more so we have plenty of chances to celebrate. Still I don't think there are enough years in one lifetime to spend with such an incredible companion.

Today, being Father's day, also marks an opportunity to celebrate 5 great kids. We love them each individually even managing them collectively is more like crowd control than parenting. I couldn't be happier.
