I saw an ad on TV last night (while learning about the history of drug addiction on the History Channel). It was sponsored by the AMA but highlights the health care crisis in the United States. [1 out of 7 people does not have health insurance.][1] This is bound to be a major topic in the upcoming election - at least it should be. I am not sure if the AMA's motives are purely altruistic or if they just want to make sure their members get paid, but providing a website where people can learn about the problem goes a long way in education the population about one of the biggest problems facing our country in this century.
