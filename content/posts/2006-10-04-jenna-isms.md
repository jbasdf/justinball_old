So Jenna is still two - almost three, but her brain has parts that must be more like 20. Callie was taking Aubrey and Alyssa to preschool the other day. Jenna goes too since you can't just leave a two year old home alone. On the way a bunch of cows had gotten out and people were chasing them to get them back into the field. Jenna says, "How come they chasing those cows? Are they going to turn them into hamburger." I wonder if she will be a vegetarian when she grows up.

She asks Callie "how come" all day every day. It drives my dear wife crazy. Today, after asking Callie, "how come," she paused looked thoughtful, and asked, "how come I say 'how come' so much?" Interesting meta-cognitive abilities.

We know when someone has been hurt, or is in bad shape in Cache Valley because life flight goes over our house on its way to Salt Lake. Jenna has to know about everything so she asked Callied 'how come' - everything starts with 'how come' these days - does that airplane fly all the time? Callie explained that it takes people who are hurt to the hospital. The other day an airplane flew over and Jenna asked Callie, "is that airplane taking somebody's mommy or daddy who is hurt to the hospital?" Sad, but observant.
