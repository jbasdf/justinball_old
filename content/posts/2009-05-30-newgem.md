I've been using newgem to build Babelphish (translation helper thing). The [docs from the ruby forge site][1] are a bit out of date. If you use newgem to build anything [be sure to look at this post from Dr Nic][2] and pay attention to the options you can pass in. In particular I noticed that the instructions on the rubyforge site indicate the gem will build a default website. If you want to do that you need to pass in the -w option.
