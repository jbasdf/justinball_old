I managed to find my riding glasses and my bike computer today. Neither were cheap, but it is interesting how little you care about that stuff when there is a gaping hole in your leg. I left both in the van when my wife took me to the hospital. I wasn't sure if I had discarded my gloves on the road, but they turned up on the shelf in the garage. I must have dropped them there on the way to the van to head to the ER. My wife washed my bike clothes - specifically my arm warmers. She said they smelled like rotting flesh. I go to the dr again in the morning. I looking forward to the day he tells me I can bend my leg again.

Now if it were just as easy to replace missing flesh as it is to replace missing bike parts....
