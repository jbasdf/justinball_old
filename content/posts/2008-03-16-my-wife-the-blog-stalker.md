I stay up very late writing code sometimes. There are weeks when I go to bed at 2 or 3 am. Actually, it isn't so much go to bed as pass out. My wife is great and supportive. She frequently stays up late with me. When you are up late and your husband is ignoring you, what's a wife to do?

Spend and evening spying on friend's and neighbors blogs that's what. For all you people out there that we know, remember she is reading so write carefully. I say that because she reads this blog. If I make an error, which I frequently do, she is thier to catch it.

What is interesting about all this is that blogging enables mass communication amongst friends. No longer do we have to tell and retell the basic boring stories. As I sit here typing this she is checking out the latest news from friends and neighbors. This is a great way to keep up on the latest news and illustrates how our lives are changing - for the better I think.

Just remember she is watching. Oh and so is the rest of the world so don't post anything you don't want your mother to read. You've been warned.
