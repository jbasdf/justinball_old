First there was the joke about [bacon chocolate chip cookies][1]. Sure somebody did it and it was funny. Then Jeremy actually made them and brought them to game night and people ate them. Thinking about it makes me dry heave.

Now Tom brings us [Mini Mos (chocolate) bacon bars][2]. My stomach may never recover.
