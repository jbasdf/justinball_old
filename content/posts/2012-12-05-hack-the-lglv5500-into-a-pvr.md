I've had this TV for a while. Turns out that accessing the services menu isn't to terribly hard if you have a programmable remote. (In my case a Logitech Harmony). The TV supports DVR functionality if you add a USB Hard drive and turn it on in the service menu.

**Warning: you can brick your TV and make it unusable. Be careful!!**

*   Step one is to setup your remote. Details:

*   This post talks about the options:

Update:
There's a python script you can use to access your TV from your PC:

There's also a little more information here on the menus:

That's pretty much it. Once the usb drive is recognized the pause button on your remote should start working.
