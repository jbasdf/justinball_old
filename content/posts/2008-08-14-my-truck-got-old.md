When I was in high school I drove a 73 Chevy Pickup. It was actually my grandmothers. It had a 350 V-8 and flushed gas like a toliet. I used to fill up the tank for $15. I always thought of it as old. I filled up my current truck the other day. It cost me $115. I realized that when I was in high school (90's) my truck was just under 20 years old. I now drive a 95 Ford F-150. It is now 13 years old. Granted it isn't as old as my truck from high school, but it is getting close. 1973 used to seem like so long ago. Hard to believe that 1993 all of a sudden seems like so long ago. At some point my truck got old.
