Biking makes me hungry. My body starts to tune into the fact that it needs to eat, a lot. I have to say no, but then I see chocolate and I start to think, "a little isn't so bad."

I live in Utah, a desert. This week it has been raining like crazy. The rain is good, but I am a wus and don't like to ride in the rain so I am getting fat while I sit around and blog.
