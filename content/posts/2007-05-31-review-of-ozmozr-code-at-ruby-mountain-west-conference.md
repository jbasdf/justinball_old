[Jamis Buck blogged about the code review of Ozmozr][1] he and [Marcel][2] did at the Mountain West Ruby Conference. The presentation was our favorite because of the insight it gave into our code and I think we came away as better programmers for it. [Here is the link to the presentation on Conference Freaks][3] and [if you want the source code they reviewed you can find it on Source Forge][4].
