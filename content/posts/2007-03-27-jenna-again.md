Nature calls to Jenna frequently in the middle of the night. The other night she got up used the facilities and then went back to bed. If the kids so much as cough Callie wakes up so of course she was awake for this event. After Jenna had gone back to her room she came back in our room and says to my wife, "Monsters aren't real." Callie, replies, "no dear." Then she went back in laid down and fell asleep.

I've concluded that Jenna doesn't actually sleep. She goes on pause. Bump the pause button in anyway and her brain is back on processing a million items from every memory she has ever had. We'll have to be careful what we let her watch on tv. I wish my computer would wake up as fast.
