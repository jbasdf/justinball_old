I am hoping this is an isolated instance. I went on a business trip this last week to Chicago. I didn't have a laptop case so on Monday I rushed down to Expercom to buy something. They sell STM brand bags. The 'medium alley' bag looked decent so I picked one up. One day into my trip into Chicago the padding on the shoulder strap had already ripped to the point that it was almost torn from the strap and the other side had already worn through.

I called Expercom and they told me tough call the manufacturer. I sent of an email to STM but their warranty states that you have to send in the bag at your expense. The bag is brand new! I paid $50 bucks for the stupid thing and now I am basically stuck with crappy merchandise. That is the last time I will be purchasing from those guys.
