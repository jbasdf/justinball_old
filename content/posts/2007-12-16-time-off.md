So my life isn't especially exciting these days except that I am taking the next couple of weeks off work. It isn't my fault really. The University will only let you carry over so many days and because I don't take very much time off it all built up and now I am home. That really just means I don't have to drive to the office. I have no doubt that I will still have to answer email and probably write code and swear a lot. -- Just like the office.

So what do I do with time off? I am hoping we can do a few fun things with the kids. There is still Christmas shopping to finish and of course I will write code. I find that when I am not writing code I can't get it out of my head and when it isn't code it is another business idea. I went to bed at 1 am this morning, woke up right at 5:30, got in the shower and ideas for software projects or business improvements started pouring through my brain.

I'd like to think that someday I will sit on a beach in the Caribbean and watch the world go by, but I think I would be bored.

I am home for the next few weeks so expect updates on all my software projects and maybe something new and exciting inside of Facebook.
