Mendon is a very small town on the west side of Cache Valley, but for three weeks in the summer it is a very cool place to be. This tiny town runs concerts in the park. Sadly I totally forgot about it until I got home last night and my lovely wife reminded me that the concert I so badly wanted to attend started at 7. My brain doesn't work the way it should sometimes.

So we rushed to Mendon and made it in time to see most of [Sarah Sample][1]'s concert. She has a beautiful voice and she writes all of her own music. If you haven't heard her artful sound I highly recommend a visit to [her site][1] and a visit to her [MySpace account][2]. I am impressed by independent artists like Sarah. She paid for and produced her albums. I asked when the next one would come out and she told me that it would be after she has paid for the current album. You have to respect an artist with that much devotion. I love her music and can't wait until she produces more so I will be recommending that everyone purchase her latest CD.

It was fun to see that a smaller community like Mendon holds something like a concert in the park. It was filled with families young and old and it made me remember why Cache Valley is such a great place to live.

There is another free concert next monday night (August 13th). This time its an acoustic variety band named John Boy's Mule.
