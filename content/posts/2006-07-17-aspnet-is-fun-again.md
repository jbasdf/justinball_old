I finally worked through most of the challenges I was faced with and I like asp.net again. It is interesting to program in several environments. I do a lot of Ruby on Rails these days and I love it. However, I have other applications that are written in ASP.Net. I have written quite a bit of Python code in the past few years - mainly in the context of Zope and Plone. If you were to ask me what the best web platform is I will still tell you that it depends. I think it is easy to get excited over the framework you love, or the one that you learned to program on. It is easy to become indoctrinated by the hype. However, at the end of the day I think it is best to stand back and look at the situation objectively rather than religiously. Over the years and through the platforms I have started to become more and more agnostic when it comes to my programing faith. Ruby on Rails may be new and exciting and it is fun to progam. It might even deserve all the hype it gets, but if it doesn't fit your project's needs it isn't right. ASP.Net meets the needs of the new Plan Collection.com site. It is stable. It is well supported. Unfortunately, it is expensive (when you figure in a license for sql server). However, the cost is still less than switching to a new technology when you consider the time involved in switching. Oh yeah, and ASP.Net is fun to code too.
