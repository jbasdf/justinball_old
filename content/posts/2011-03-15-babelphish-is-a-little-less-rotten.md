I've let Babelphish sit for a while. It did what it was supposed so why change it? Then Michael Jenik offered some changes that made it compatible with the latest Google Translate API. To work with the latest API you have to get a key, but it's pretty easy to do and babelphish will look for it in your home directory. [Check out the readme on github for the details][1] and let me know if there are bugs. If you have any questions the answer is 42. Happy translating!
