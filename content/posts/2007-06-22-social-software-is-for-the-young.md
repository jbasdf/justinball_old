[An interesting study by business week shows who is doing what on line][1]. The visualization helps to show what is in many ways obvious - young people are more likely to do social things online.

I don't think this is bad.

I think it means that over the next decade social software is going to become more pervasive. There are a lot of successes in the Web 2.0 space right now, but I think they are only the beginning. Future tools will help us communicate and collaborate in a global way.
