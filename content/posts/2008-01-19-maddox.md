We went out to eat on our way back from running errands in Ogden. Finding a restaurant on a Saturday night in an unfamiliar area that you can take four kids to is not a trivial task. In spite of having made this journey so many times before we still havenâ€™t figured it out. Tonight we wanted to try something different and since we would be going through Brigham City around dinner we went to Maddox. If you have never been to Maddox you should try it someday. It is a true family restaurant. My parents took us there when I was a kid and my grandparents took my parents there when my parents were kids. It has been around for a while. Anyway, we received the best service I have had from any restaurant, which is truly something to be said considering we were hauling our kids into a packed restaurant on a Saturday night. The waitress was great with the kids and even helped them with the little things It is nice to know there is still a place you can go that is friendly and has great service.
