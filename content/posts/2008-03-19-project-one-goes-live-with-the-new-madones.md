Just in time for riding season Trek has decided to turn on [Project One][1]. I am not sure if that means that they are planning on fulfilling those orders before the end of summer or not but it gives me something to drool over. I didn't see prices, but I am betting that the bike I configured with SRAM Red probably cost more than my car.

Now, having said all that and after coming of my drooling high [Cycling News did a review of the Madone 6.9][2]. Their conclusion was that the 5.2 was almost as good of a bike. It weighs 600 grams more. However, most of the weight savings comes from the expensive wheels which shave 290 grams. The new Ultegra SL looks cool, works great and is almost as light as Dura-ace. You can almost buy two 5.2s for the cost of a 6.9 which means that I could get one for myself and one for the wife.

At any rate I think I might head to the local shop at lunch and find out what my riding habit is going to cost this summer.
