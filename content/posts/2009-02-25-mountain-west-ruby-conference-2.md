I've been to a good number of conferences over the years. A lot of them cost a lot of money. If you are a geek and a ruby lover (who isn't?) then the best event you'll ever attend is the [Mountain West Ruby conference][1]. [The schedule is up][2].

It's only a hundred bucks and the best of the best show up. [Get registered now][3] so you don't hate yourself in the morning.
