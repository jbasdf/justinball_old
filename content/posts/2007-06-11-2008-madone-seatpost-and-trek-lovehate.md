[Interesting discussion on the new 2008 Trek Madone seatpost][1]. Some people like it others hate it. There seem to be plenty of people that don't like Trek just because they are a big company. Personally, I like them because they are a US company, make good bikes, and have a good warranty. Aside from smaller builders - [Calfee][2], [Crumpton][3], and [Parlee][4], Trek is the only company that builds their own bikes right here in the US. I don't know where Trek gets their carbon. I would like to know that. [Time actually makes their carbon from the fiber][5] (click on company and then Time Visit on the left hand side. Their site nav kinda sucks.
