Yup, I got one. I was going to go mountain biking at lunch today, but instead I got suckered into going down to the local AT&T store and waiting for 7 hours to get one of these babies.

They are cool.

The screen is sweet. The interface is slick. I love to browse through my albums. It is almost like the old Juke boxes you could find in burger joints. For my next trick I need to find out how to import my contacts from my old phone.

As for waiting.

Today was quite productive. I, Dave Ray and David Wiley managed to brainstorm all kinds of ideas and we met with the Nepal group for a while. The meeting turned out to be really awesome. One of the guys is interested in and currently working on a GeoStories like idea that Marion was looking into about a year ago. More on that another time (like after it is built).
