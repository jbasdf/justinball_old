I haven't posted a lot lately. A lot of people with blogs say that and they suck because of it so I guess I suck too. Instead of being a radical nut job I am moving back into being a developer nut job. In addition to working on eduCommons at work I have been focusing on [scrumdidilyumptio.us][1]. If you want to know what it does click on the link. I think it's cool. I am also gearing up to work on another interesting project that will gather data from all your favorite [blogs][2]/[bookmark sites][3]/ and maybe even your [gedcom ][4]data. It might just be cool. I have more or less quit playing Battlefield at night and have been focusing on a project I call ggugg. It will be an interesting way to manage your personal life. I think. I'll post a link when its ready to go. Of course I am still working on [The Plan Collection][5]. [House plans][5] are still a hobby and something fun. So ya, I am like busy.
