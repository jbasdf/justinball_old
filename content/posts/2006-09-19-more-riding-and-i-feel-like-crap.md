I had the chance to ride Smithfield canyon after work. Riding in the fall is interesting. The weather is warm and then cold so dressing correctly is difficult. The canyon is beautiful and a fun ride. As the leaves turn it should only get better.
The bad news is that I now feel like crap which is odd because usually after a ride I feel pretty good. My rides to work this have not been good and the ride tonight was fun, but my legs felt like they lacked the energy to do well on the ride.
I could just be getting old, but I think diet and sleep are key here so I am going to bed and I will never eat that nasty frosting from the store bought cakes again. Shortening and sugar are bad. Very bad.
