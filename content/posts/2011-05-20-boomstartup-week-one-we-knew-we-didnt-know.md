I think our biggest question going into BoomStartup was "is this really worth 6% of our company?" Now that week one is coming to a close I believe that the answer is yes. Both Joel and I are tech guys and academics. We've spent a lot of time writing code and a lot of time reading research. Both of those activities give you skills and background to build stuff in intelligent ways. Still there was something we knew we were missing. As an engineer in college we made fun of the business guys - they were the ones that dropped out of engineering.

Having exposure to seasoned entrepreneurs like Robb Kunz has helped provide perspective on the startup process. We have entered a more chaotic state then we were in before, but the chaos is a result of spending time examining our business model and preparing to talk to customers to validate our assumptions.

I anticipate that in the next few months we'll be throwing away some of the code that we worked hard on. That's painful, but I'm hoping that through the now popular [Lean Startup process][2] that we are following we can eliminate waste going forward and build something customers will love.

Now we know that's there's even more we don't know. It's going to be a fun summer.
