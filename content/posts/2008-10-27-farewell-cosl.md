For sometime now I have known that my time at COSL was running out. I wasn't sure exactly when it would expire, but last Friday basically became my last day. I know that there have been various issues surrounding the center, but think what you may it would be hard to find a gathering of more intelligent and talented people. Game night has been an extension of our daily work and will continue to be a gathering of the best minds. It has provided myself and each of my colleagues an outlet and a proof that COSL was more than just a place to work. I think most organizations struggle to develop within the kind of comradeship that grew organically from mutual respect and friendship.

It has been a long time since I was part of such a gifted group of individuals. Thank you to all my friends and I look forward to our continued efforts towards world domination, or at least the part of that undertaking that involves being able to pay the bills.
