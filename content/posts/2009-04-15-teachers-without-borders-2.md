Tonight we transferred control of the Teachers Without Borders website to a new provider. I've worked with Teachers Without Borders for more than a year now. I was granted a fellowship that allowed me to work with them to build a social network that will help teachers world-wide. Like any developer that has poured a lot of time into a project I have mixed feelings about passing the project onto another group. On the one hand it is a relief since maintenance of the project can be stressful. On the other hand not having to worry about making sure the site is running from day to day reduces a large burden.

I was talking to my wife the other day about the situations my mother-in-law, a first grade teacher, has seen over the years. In this modern age of consumerism it is easy to forget that there are many in dire circumstances. We think that the problem is out there, in Africa, in Asia, somewhere else. The truth is in this 'great nation' kids still come to school in the winter without coats. Parents neglect their children - don't wash their clothes, don't feed them, and even abandon them. Our future is also our most vulnerable population.

Most of the time I feel pretty powerless to make any significant different, but working with Teachers Without Borders has given me the opportunity to hopefully contribute in some small but meaningful way.

Teachers are treated poorly. Parents love to complain but rarely praise their efforts. They deal with salaries that are a pittance compared to what they are worth (think of what a difference a teacher makes versus the latest crop of CEOs and ask yourself who has done more and deserves better).

My thanks goes to all the teachers who have made such a difference in my life and to all those around the world who are trying to make this planet a better place.
