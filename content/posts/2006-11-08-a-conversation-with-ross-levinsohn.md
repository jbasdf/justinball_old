Arranged the deal and bought Myspace. Youtube is their biggest strategic partner. On the Internet may of your biggest competitors are also your partners. Google will power search on the news corp sites. They get to sell advertising, and news corp gets 900 million. Myspace cost 580 million. Not a bad deal.
However, he also said about Myspace, “I don’t sleep, it’s why I put on 30 pounds over the last year.” These businesses take work. Spent the last nine months building out software and hardware.
After we bought the site we spent a lot of time on safety.

Why doesn’t Myspace open their APIs? They are thinking of it. Talk to Tom. Lot’s of people bring this up. Dan Gould (My Space employee) likes the idea.
