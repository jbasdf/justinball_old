As a follow up to the post I did a bit back explaining [how to write ruby code to talk to Amazon.com][1] I have also built a site that makes it simple to get your [Amazon.com Wishlist RSS][2]. This should make your life a bit easier if you want to integrate your rss feed into your blog or site. It does embed my associates id. Feel free to change it if you have your own or leave it if you are feeling generous. Enjoy.
