So I have owned this domain name for several years now and haven't done
anything with it which is something I really should be ashamed of (I'm
not).  There are other people out there with the name Justin Ball
who probably would have put something here by now.  In fact, there
is another Justin Ball right here in Logan, Utah.  I know, I get
calls for him sometimes.  That scares me.  I now have a
reason to put something here which comes in the form of "persuasion"
from [David Wiley][1].  I am taking a class and in order to get credit
in a PhD program and they expect you to actually do something bla bla
bla.  Why can't people just learn to code?  That's where the
love is.  It is odd to be motivated by an assignment since blogs
are supposed to be organic, bottom up, individuals doing their own
thing.  Since I am being "motivated" does that make Wiley the
"man."  (As in the one they set on fire in the Nevada desert not
as in "you da man."  Anyway, since years of owning a domain with
my name attached hasn't persuaded me to post anything, I guess I need
some sort of motivation to get off my butt, and in that case Wiley is
"da man" to make me do it.  I don't really want you people to know
much about me cause "the man" will probably end up reading this and the
FBI/NSA/CIA/Homeland security people will show up and throw me in a prison in
some third world country where they can toture US citizens for saying
things like "George Dubya is a moron."  Well stick as many needles
in me as you want, he is.  Have you ever heard him speak?  I
am sure the Utah chapter of the young republicans will be toliet
papering my house as soon as this is posted.

I digress, a lot.  If  you don't like it tough sH1t cause this is my blog and I will write whatever I want. 

It took a while but I finally got this community server blog thing
installed.  I couldn't use some blog spot or whatever because I am
an engineer and damnit I may dress like a dork and keep pens in my
pocket, but  I can setup my own blog software and put it on my own
domain name on my own server.  If I was really cool I would write
my own blog software.  It doesn't make sense but I am an engineer
and it this is my place in the universe so it doesn't have to make
sense.

I have debating the "about me" thing.  It is a tradition followed
by millions of teenage girl blog devotees for whom the "about me" blog
post is the first (and last post).  Posting an "about me" 
seems like admiting to being a slacker (I am) since it is usually the
first post (this is), and if I was really geeky cool then I would have
done this five years ago like all the really popular geeks.  Ask
me if I care.  I am tired of writing so here it is.

I am Justin

I am an engineer

I write code

I have a wife

I have 3 kids

I work for [OSLO][2] ([COSL][3]?) - would someone figure this out please?

I am a PhD student (at [USU][4])

I like pickles and my oatmeal is cold



When I am not playing Battlefield, working, or sleeping I also spend
time working on a website I own part of where  house plans are
sold - www.theplancollection.com.  It is written in ASP I
know.  Python (I love it) is better, I know.  Microsoft is
satan , I know.  I don't make fun of your happy hands club so
leave me alone.
