Last week I rode around Bear Lake - 52 miles. The next day it was up BlackSmith Fork canyon - 27 miles. Stupid wasp hit me in the lip on the way back and stung me. My mouth swoll to the size of a small apricot in a matter of minutes. Stupid wasps. This time marked the second time. The first time I had one go down my jersey and sting me five or six times. I don't ride with my jersey unzipped anymore. Saturday I did the metric centry - 64 miles. I was to big of a pansy to ride the 100. Maybe I'll try that next year. I almost rode to work today except I made it two miles and heard an explosion. My rear tire literaly blew up. I guess they weren't rated for the pressure I was putting in (120psi). This does however mean I get new tires. It is midnight now and I am writing code. I wouldn't be doing this if I was riding tomorrow. I have to chose these days. However, I am hoping to have a new site up for ThePlanCollection.com within a few weeks. [The beta site for our house plans is here][1]. Have a look and see what keeps me up at nights.
