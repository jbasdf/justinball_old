The Desert News is saying what we already know. [Cache Valley is a great place to live][1]. Of course the numbers don't tell the actual story. This is a great place to live because it has a small town feel, the biking is awesome and people are friendly. The schools are great and you feel safe. The biggest drawback to living in Cache Valley is the low wages. For many jobs the university tends to pay very poorly and economic development around here so far has meant adding a Home Depot and second Walmart. Hopefully we start to see the kind of economic development that is sustainable and that provides good, well paying jobs.
