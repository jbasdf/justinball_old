Too much research can fry one's brain. I have been looking for a new road bike forever. In the meantime my lust for the dirt has been growing so I bought a new [Blur XC with SRAM X0][1]. Once upon a time I spent a lot of time on a mountain bike. That was a decade ago. The Blur XC is amazing. I have only ridden it for a short period of time, but it is awesome. More after I take it in the hills.
