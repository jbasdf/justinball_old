Today is 4/20. That is significant for two reasons. One is that it is my parent's wedding anniversary. My dad likes to get license plates with significant numbers. For years the plate on our van was 11111. Later it was [1701][1] (any Star Trek fans recognize that number?). When my parents got a new car it was time for a new license plate and a new number. My dad snagged 420 when it came up because of it's relation to their wedding day.

Then funny things started to happen. As they drove down the road kids would honk, give them peace signs and cheer as they passed. At gas stations random youth would pose by my parent's car to get their picture taken. It was a year before my dad was having a conversation with one of my more colorful cousins and told him about the situation. My cousin busted up laughing and then gave my dad [the lowdown on 420][2].

His plate now reads 204.
