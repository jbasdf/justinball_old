I was pretty excited to see the new app store show up on iTunes. As a faithful fan of everything Apple I was looking forward to this big event.

Now?

Meh, I could take it or leave it. I just spent half an hour browsing through the applications. I downloaded some because they are there, but really who is going to pay 10 bucks for Tetris? I have to believe that the platform is going to provide an opportunity for some killer app that hasn't been thought of as of yet. I would really love a shell so I can ssh into my servers. Until then all I have to say is what's the big deal eh?
