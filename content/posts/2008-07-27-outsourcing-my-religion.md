I got up at 6:30 am this morning so that I could serve in what is know as a 'calling' in my church. I have done this for two years now.

Anyone that knows me knows that I don't get up at 6:30. Sometimes I stay up and work until 6:30, but I don't get up at that time. That is unless God wants me to. Thus, on the 'day of rest' I drag my butt out of bed way to early in the morning so that I can go and do something else I never do - take notes by hand. I have used a computer for so many years now that I can type like mad, but I can barely use a pen. My signature is just a bunch of loopy lines and no one and I mean no one can read what I write. However, I take notes because that is my religious duty.

Truthfully, I don't mind it so much. I get to associate with people who are far more righteous than me. I keep thinking some of that spirituality will wear off on my, but it doesn't really so I have decided on a new course of action.

The latest trend is outsourcing. It started with programming. Get guys in India or various other countries to do your work for pennies on the dollar and stop paying these expensive local boys. It will work just like it did in manufacturing. (I'm not bitter). I heard that you can outsource a personal assistant. Heck, if you are willing to travel heart surgery in a foreign land is like a luxury vacation - except for that one part where they cut you open, but then again maybe that makes your journey more like an Indian Jones movie. Hopefully, they use something more sterile than their bare hands.

I would really like to spend my Sunday mornings in bed. After all, I am a very lazy person. However, I really need the spiritual benefits. Call them credits in heaven.

In this United States land of box stores, outlets, big cars, and urban sprawl we get what we want. I am simply unwilling to accept that I can't have it all so starting today I will be outsourcing all my religion. Call my effort modern day [indulgences][1] advanced. Instead of just buying away sin I will be having various kind hearted souls in foreign lands deal with my volunteer work, salvation and other spiritual matters. I even plan on offering this service to others so that they may reap eternal rewards while sleeping in, reading the paper or just enjoying a Sunday afternoon in the park.
