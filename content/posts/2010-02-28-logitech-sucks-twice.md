Last Christmas my wife bought me a Logitech Harmony remote. Over the past few months I've noticed that it barely holds a charge and so if I don't leave it on the charger all the time it just dies. Last night I went to use the remote and it burned my hand it was so hot. I figured I would check the battery and found that it had bulged out and deformed. I surfed around and found that a bunch of other people had the same problem. I called tech support. They told me that it was a problem and they I should safely dispose of the battery and buy a new one. I told them I've had it for one year (it was two days out of warranty). They told me tough luck. I complained a lot and they finally relented and sent me a new battery. However, now I'm scared to leave it on the charger. I let it run most of the way down before charging it up again since most of the people on who wrote about the problem indicated that the remote will overcharge the battery causing it to get hot. If you have a Logitech remote check the battery occasionally in case the battery starts bulging. I think BestBuy can recycle them.

I also have an Logitech MX Revolution that I used to use. It was a good mouse until I changed my time machine backups to use a server instead of a USB Drive. The change meant that the backups now happen over my Wifi connection. Right after the change I noticed was that my mouse stopped working every time the backup kicked on. The mouse uses the same 2.4Ghz spectrum as the 802.11 card and the flood of data from the backup would kill the mouse connection. I called their tech support on this one too to see if there was a solution. Their idea? Get a different mouse and plug it in during the backup then plug the Logitech mouse back in. (Every hour during the Time Machine backup). I bought an Apple Magic mouse instead and then replaced my Logitech keyboard with one of the latest from Apple.

I'm done buying Logitech.
