I am not sure how many years [Jones soda has been doing this, but for a
limited time during the holiday season you can get a variety of
drinks][1].  Brussels Sprout with Prosciutto, Cranberry Sauce, Turkey & Gravy, Wild Herb Stuffing,
and Pumpkin Pie are all included in their national pack.  There is
a regional pack available in limited areas that comes with smoked salmon pate.  Enjoy.
