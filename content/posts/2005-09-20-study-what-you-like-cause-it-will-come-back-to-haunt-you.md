title: study what you like cause it will come back to haunt you.

One frequent conversation amongst engineers entails the bragging of how
hard their undergrad education was.  This is usually measured by
two factors:

1. How poorly the class performed overall

2. How late one stayed in the computer labs.



My dad always told me that your educational experience would reflect
the job environment in the real world.  It's almost 11 pm
now.  We are still working.  I am sitting in a "lab" in a
building on campus.  As I look out the window I see students in
various states of exhaustion.  I remember my days in the labs, the
days I use for bragging rights, and I have to laugh at dad's
prophecy.  My education and my job match almost perfectly. 
The only difference is that the lab has shifted a couple hundred yards
to the northwest from the engineering to the education building. 
eduCommons 1.5.2 is almost ready.  Really dear, I will be home
soon.
