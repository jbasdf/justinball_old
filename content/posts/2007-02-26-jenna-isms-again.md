My kids are good for the most part. They really are. However, I have no idea what goes through Jenna's mind. Here is the latest from her:

We were headed to dinner Saturday night and I found her wandering the house with one shoe. She told me, "I have a missing shoe. I know where I left it, but I don't know where it is." I think we have all had that happen, but she is 3.

Last night, after Callie told them again to stop jumping on the couch she said, "When I'm grown'd up I'm going to jump on my bed an my couch." Funny how when we do grow up we forget about all the things that would have been so fun as a kid.

A few weeks ago when Callie had Jenna out shopping Jenna turned to her and said, "Mom, when you are a hundred you will die."

And recently she told us, "If you squeeze the kitty really tight it will die." Yikes.

My personal favorite came yesterday. She loves puppies. She told us, "I want a puppy. I want a puppy that eats other puppies - the mean ones."

I swear we don't let her watch late night tv, but I think I understand why she has vivid dreams.
