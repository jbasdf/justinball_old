I am writing Ruby code today and all of a sudden I need a fix for bike porn so I do my usual search for Time bikes, this time the Time VXS which is supposed to be a comfort bike. [I end up at VeloGoGo][1] and read about a special VXS built for Tom Boonen. [Then I notice 2008 Trek Madone: The Un-BILF][2] and think I have to read this. About an hour later I have made my way through the [latest][3] [news ][4][on the][5] [2008][6][Trek][7] Madone and my lust is off the charts. Here's the [official site][8] and [a blog by Ben Coates, the Discovery Team Liaison for Trek Bicycles.][9] [Lennard Zinn's report is probably the most informative article available right now.][10]

I am sure there will be more. Trek is loved and hated. I want to know how it rides which means I have to find one to ride.

Trek is back on my short list. I love that they are made in the United States and better yet there is a local shop that sells them so I don't have to drive an hour and a half. Now I just need to find someone willing to let me ride one.
