All of my ASP.Net work these days is for ThePlanCollection.com so I have started publishing my problems and hopefully some solutions there. [My most recent problem was the "hexadecimal value 0x1A, is an invalid character" exception when writing out xml. Click the link to get the code to fix the problem][1].
