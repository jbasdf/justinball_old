For 57 years the Ball family has held an annual reunion. This year was the last. Alfred William Ball was my great grandfather. This many years later the family has gotten so large that I don't really know/recognize anyone. For that very reason I was very careful who I dated in high school and I went out of state to find a wife.

I have always wondered about my ancestors. As far as I knew no one had any information about their lives. By total luck I talked with the one person at the reunion who just happened to mention that she found this website for the [Weight Family][1]. It has some information about where the Ball family came from. These types of discoveries are why I love the internet.
