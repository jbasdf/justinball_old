I'm a big WordPress fan. They make really great stuff. I was really excited when the gallery feature came out several versions ago. It worked fine until I needed to change the image sizes for a post that I'm working on. It might just be me but finding the right way to change the images took a while. I ran across a few posts that recommended changing the core WordPress code. To me that's a bad idea. I'd overwrite it for sure and never know that I messed things up. Then I found the [gallery short code guide][1]. That was a lot of help. I also found a plugin called [PhotoJAR][2] which adds a few nice features to your galleries. Now back to the long post.
