Lance 's return to cycling is something that I am sure many people are watching with anticipation and curiosity. He is one of the greatest if not the greatest cyclist of all time. Personally, I like to see the equipment Trek is setting him up with. Here's a few links to pictures of his new Madone in LIVESTRONG colors:

It took 30 hours to paint the bike and it shows.

I have to also say that after watching cancer have such a terrible impact on so many people I also admire Lance's efforts to promote cancer awareness.

Here are the numbers painted on the bike:
1274 - The number of days Lance was "retired".
27.5 - million people is the approximate number of people that died from cancer during that same time.
