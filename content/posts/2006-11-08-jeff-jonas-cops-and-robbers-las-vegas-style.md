Helped track down the MIT teams in Las Vegas.
Corporate amnesia. Ie marketing sends credit card offer to a guy in jail who just defrauded the company. Companies have multiple database systems that need to coordinate.

Data and queries are the same thing. Queries persist and you ask every smart question (query) all the time.

Civil liberties and privacy become a big deal. What is appropriate to ask? What if the librarian – app putting stuff in or out is corrupt?

You can anonomize – if I take a grinder and a pig you get sausage but if I give you sausage and a grinder you don’t get back a pig.

Sequence neutrality. No matter what order your data arrives in your result is the same.
