[Shimano has released a new version][1] of their Ultegra group. It comes in an ice grey color which is pretty cool and a bit lighter. The group includes an Ultegra branded compact crank which I am assuming will replace the R700.

I made a visit to a Trek dealer to see the new Madone 5.2 and 5.5. They hadn't built up the bikes yet, but the new Ultegra components were attached and looked pretty sweet.

My question is when does Shimano plan on releasing a new Dura Ace? At the very least a Dura Ace level compact crank would be nice. Campy Record weighs less (but also quite a bit more expensive, at least here in the states). Isn't it time Shimano caught up and brought us the next generation of top level components?
