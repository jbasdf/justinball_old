We are at the Ruby Conference this weekend. The Ruby community is active, talented and friendly. I mean that. Often, because of religious zeal open source communities act very closed to individuals outside their group. The Ruby world isn't like that. Everyone wants to help. Everyone is friendly.

The talks have been good, but like any conference it is what happens between the talks that matters. We met a couple of guys from Logan doing Ruby. That gives us a lot more motivation to put 100% into a Logan Ruby users group.

The most exciting and painful moment of the conference for us will come in just a few minutes. [ Jamis Buck][1] and [Marcel Molina][2] have agreed to review one of our apps in front of the group. You can't get better feedback than feedback from members of the core Rails team. Of course we'll have to show our code to the entire audience and that will hurt but I am sure we'll get over it.

I'll blog what they have to say in just a minute.
