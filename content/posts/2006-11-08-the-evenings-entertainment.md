I hear that at past Web 2.0 conferences dinner on the second night was left to the attendees. This year AOL provided dinner and entertainment in the form of [Lou Reed][1]. I like music but I must admit that I had no idea who this guy was until I looked him up and found that site. I guess old rock and roll superstar and new web companies are meant to go together - somehow.
