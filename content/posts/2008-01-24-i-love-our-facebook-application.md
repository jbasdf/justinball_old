While our [house plans application on Facebook][1] is not anywhere near as popular as Superpoke nor will it ever be it is a great application for me because the Facebook users find house plans that I have never noticed before. With the family being the size it is we need a larger home, but if I think this is a very cool [small house plan][2]. Social media has some very interesting and beneficial side effects. For me it is serendipitous discovery.
