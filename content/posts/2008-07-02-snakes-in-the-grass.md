Last week right before we left for Yellowstone I went out to work on the sprinklers for the garden. I threw on some flip flops because that was easy. While walking around I felt something go over my foot. I thought it was the grass brushing against me ( I don't like to mow the lawn so it gets long sometimes ). When I looked down I discovered that we have a bit of wildlife living in the garden. A two foot long [garter snake][1] slithered off into the neighbor's yard.

I thought it was gone.

I told my girls about it. Later when they were outside I heard then yelling about a snake. I figured they were making it up. They do that. Right before we left I went out to water the garden. There it was again.

I left it alone. They eat mice and bugs and stuff.

Today my wife almost stepped on it. According to Wikipedia they can have 50 offspring at a time.

Now the snake has to go.
