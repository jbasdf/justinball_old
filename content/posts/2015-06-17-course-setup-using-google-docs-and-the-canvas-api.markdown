<p>From my presentation at <a href="http://www.canvaslms.com/news/instructurecon/">InstructureCon 2015</a>:</p>

<h4>About us</h4>
<p>We're <a href="http://www.atomicjolt.com/c/canvas-landing.html">Atomic Jolt</a>. We build cool stuff. We built some of the very first Canvas integrations using LTI and the Canvas API. We've been doing this as long as Canvas has been around. Anything you want Canvas to do that it doesn't already do we'll make it do it.</p>

<a href="http://demoarigato.herokuapp.com/">Demo Arigato</a> simplifies the repetitive task of setting up the same courses, users, discussions etc. We created it for the sales team at <a href="http://www.instructure.com/">Instructure</a>, but you can use it in your Canvas instance as well.
