MySQL has been about giving structured data to structured systems. So now “their” idea is to do what Google has done and get people to open source their data, share that data, then allow the world to access it like a database. “The biggest database in the world is already out there.” Build a “skype for databases.” You can go to Google to search, but the data is not all in the same format.

Here are his considerations
Latency is decreasing.
We may need a DNS of SQL Servers
Routing may be an issue
How do you make data definitions available and understandable to others?
Payments needed?
Use RSS, Atom, HTML, HTTP etc as transport mechanisms.

I don’t believe that this is their idea I am pretty sure that it came from the talk that Adam Bosworth gave at the MySQL conference last year. I agree that the web should be our next database - the wealth of data available could provide humanity with insane access to knowledge.

One of the VCs on the first day talked about one of the problems their funded companies are having – latency. Given the time required to run a query in Ozmozr with 90k records I think it would be difficult to run that query over the internet to a thousand distributed databases. However, there are a lot of smart people out there and so perhaps they can solve the problem.
