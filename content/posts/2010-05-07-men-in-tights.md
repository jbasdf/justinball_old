My MacBook died today. When you write code for a living that really sucks. Then I ran out of M&Ms. That sucks a lot too.

Snow be damned when everything else falls apart you simply must ride so I and Joel headed up Left Hand Fork in a spring blizzard because, well, after you get dressed up in tights there's no going back.

When we parked the truck the snow was falling pretty hard. The sky was darkening. It was getting cold. We had driven all that way so turning back wasn't an option.

Further and further we ascending, snow attempting to drive us back to the warmth of the truck, but by hell we were men in tights and guys with that level of resolve don't turn back.

Then the weather cleared and we did what any self-respecting guy would do we kept going higher and higher. Time finally forced us to turn back and in a way time was finally on our side. Not long into our decent the snow returned for revenge and our epic spring ride began. Unable to feel our fingers we gave up on using the brakes (real men don't need them anyway). Faster and faster we rode, the snow piled in our path, wolves howled in the distance. We faced the pedaled to the very edge of death and came back victors.

Back at the truck I warmed my fingers just enough to find the keys hidden in my jacket. As the blood returned to our extremities the sting, more than a normal human could bear, reminded us what it means to be alive.

You might think us crazy for riding in the mountains, far from help, snow and cold pushing us towards death, but you'd be wrong. That's not what makes us crazy. That we're going to do it again tomorrow is what makes us crazy (oh and the tights probably mark us as a bit nuts too).
