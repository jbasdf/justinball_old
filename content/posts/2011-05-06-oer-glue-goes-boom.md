We've been building OER Glue since this last July and the result is a piece of technology that when people see it they have the same reaction they have during a magic show - HOLY SH@#$ how do you do that?

We think it's pretty cool.

Beyond pretty cool we feel like it's an idea that can have a significant impact on online education. OER Glue makes it simple to find and then remix Open Education Resources with popular services. [You can get a beta code here][1].

Our big news for the day is that we have been selected to join the [BoomStartup][2] program for the summer. We are extremely excited for the opportunity and feel that the experience will help us bring the technology and subsequently a new kind of learning experience to learners world wide.
