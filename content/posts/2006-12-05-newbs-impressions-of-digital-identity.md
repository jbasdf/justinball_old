I am new to the area of Digital Identity but I think that it is pretty dang confusing. I will show my ignorance here, but I am OK with that. I thought that OSIS was setup to unify the different groups, but then there is Identity Commons which OSIS is a part of and that is supposed to be the grand unifying symbol.

I understand that when a group of people meet in a single place and chat the group naturally redefines itself over time. Part of that process is changing names and coming up with new terms and definitions. However, such actions make it difficult for those of us who are not part of the 'in crowd.' We are the users that don't know about these conferences(by serendipity we met Phil Windley just a few months ago), but who are still in charge of implementing these solutions. Finding out about the different solutions using a Google search can become confusing and tedious. Every new term that is added only adds to that pain. Wide adoption demands simplicity. As any given solution becomes more diverse/complicated/scattered/hard to document/longer adoption of that solution will decrease. I think the inverse is also true. If the solution is well documented, is simple to implement(even if it has complex additional functionality the initial implementation for any given user should be simple) has examples in many languages for many platforms and presents a unified front to the world its adoption will increase.
Developers often talk about building solutions that are simple for end users. The result of this action is greater use of the product. The same principle applies to code. Make it easy for other developers and more people will use your stuff.
