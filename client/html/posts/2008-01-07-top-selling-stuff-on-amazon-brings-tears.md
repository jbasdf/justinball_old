I am always looking for a deal so I keep trying to find one on Amazon Grocery. The problem is that you can waste a lot of time trying to find something you would really buy.

So I try the top sellers page:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/grocery/ref=sv\_gro\_1/104-6217951-1925564

Notice the top sellers are baby items, coffee and diet pills (at least they are right now) and deep in my heart I have to feel bad for all the mothers who are up late with the kids and trying to lose weight.

No wonder we are a Prozac nation.
