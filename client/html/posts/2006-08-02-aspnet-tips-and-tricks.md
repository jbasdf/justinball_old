Scott Guthrie is the man when it comes to ASP.Net - he is in charge of it and it is basically his brain child. Those around the world that write code for the web using a Microsoft platform owe him big kudos. Anyway, when he speaks it is wise to listen. He has a list of ["Tricks, Tips and Gotchas" for ASP.Net][1]. Worth a read.
