I managed to get out and inspect my bike a bit more tonight. Turns out that I did more than just scrap the handlebars. Putting any downward pressure on the hoods bends the right side. When I hit I must have crushed the carbon. It will be interesting to see what they look like when I pull the tape off. I am betting it won't be a pretty site. I'm not really surprised I guess. The bars are super light and with the small amount of carbon they use I don't think they were intended to make it through a direct impact.

Still I can't find a scratch on the frame, fork or wheels. That is good news. Bars are easy to replace. An entire bike is not.
