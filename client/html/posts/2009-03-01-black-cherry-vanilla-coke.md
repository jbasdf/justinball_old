I don't drink a lot of soda so when I do drink it it has to be good. A couple of years ago Coke came out with a flavor that I grew to love - Black Cherry Vanilla. I bought a couple of 12 packs and kept them in the basement. I drank the last one this weekend.

First the recession and now my last Black Cherry Vanilla Coke. When will the pain end?
