For years I have relied soley on typing to keep me in shape. Most of the frameworks I have used managed to help me keep the pounds off. They required plenty of code and my fingers were left in great condition. Then I found Ruby on Rails and the pounds started to come on. I just haven't been typing as much. Damn you Rails and your miniscule amount of code.

Because of this new condition I was forced to buy a bike. Ok it might have been gas prices too. Here it is:

I have almost 70 miles on it after one week which is nothing compared to all those hard core guys out there, but it helps with my new found typing exercise deficit.
