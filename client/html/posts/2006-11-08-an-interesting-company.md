Yesterday Vox.com announced they are open for busines. This is an interesting company to me because it is similar to ozmorz. If you listen to thier story and then to ours they sound like the same thing. A closer examination makes me think that we are still different. However, the fact that John Battelle called Six Apart and asked them to release their new software at this event tells me that simple applications that aggrate data and do something interesting are valid and in fact sexy to the web 2.0 world.
