My first chance to really use the new Blur XC came last night just a few hours after I picked it up. Aside from my test ride in the parking lot last night was my first real mountain bike riding in over a decade. David, his wife Leslie, his brother Brian and Marc - the bike shop owner all rode. Marc is hardcore. He just took first place in the Norba nationals in Deer Valley. Leslie and Brian were amazing as well.

I nearly died.

Our trip took us up Ricks canyon. Being completely unfamiliar with any trails in this area I didn't care where we went. I was just excited to get on my brand new sweet bike.

Big mistake.

Ricks Canyon is a natural torture chamber. Someone forgot to actually make a trail and instead figured that anyone who would want to climb here was really stupid and deserved what they got - a constant stream of loose rocks and small boulders mixed with tree roots.

So ya I am a wus.

The climb left my heart pounding so heart I was sure it would exit my chest. This was my first time in the hills on clipless pedals. I used brand new Crank Brothers Eggbeaters. I like them, but having some platform on the pedal would probably be a good idea for a newb like me that has to try to clip in to the tiny pedals on a 10% incline. Not an easy task.

The views from top were amazing - the kind of thing you see in mountain bike brochures. Cache Valley is a beautiful place. On the descent I was glad to have full suspension. The bike took the trail well and saved my sorry butt more than a few times. At high speed down the single track it tackled large boulders with ease and flying off the tree roots that we had endured on the way up was a blast. The sound of rocks slamming into my thousand dollar wheels on the way down was not comforting, but during the entire ride I was glad every second that I bought this bike. It is light for a mountain bike. It is fast. It climbs well. It descends well.

Its capabilities far exceed the skills of the rider.

That's a good thing. I went blasting through a section at high speed - didn't mean to just didn't brake soon enough. It was one of the more terrifying moments of the ride. I was going way to fast hitting 2 foot boulders and racing through loose gravel. I am pretty sure that the bike save me there. 

In the mean time of course this was just another day for Marc. Leslie and Brian took the entire thing with ease. 

I need to ride more.

So my return to mountain biking was a good one. I love being in the outdoors on a bike. The scenery is amazing. The uphill should help me build a stronger heart. Every second of the ride I couldn't help but smile and think to myself this is awesome. Santa Cruz has my vote. The Blur XC is a great bike and the SRAM X0 group did exactly what I asked it to every time. 

I have the MS150 this weekend so it will be a few days before I am on the bike again. Regardless I can't wait to find myself in the dirt more often.
