So the new Santa Cruz Blur is very bling. I like to look at it. It makes me happy. It is very light and very silver. Tonight will be the first real trail ride. I'll let you know how it goes. Marc at Wimmers (bike shop) threw on some egg beater pedals. They are actually harder to clip into than my road pedals. We'll see how that goes tonight.
