Have a Merry Christmas. My kids learned to read today (the 24th
actually. I am just up really late, again) - at least they
started down the right path. It's not due to any effort on our
part. They were in the tub and started sounding out the foam
letters on the shower surround. Callie put the into words and
they sounded them out correctly. It's a first step.

Now that is a cool Christmas present.
