Listening to the news in the car this morning there are protests in Egypt because the high price of fuel has driven up the cost of grain which has driven up the cost of government subsidized bread.
The news story was the first time I had heard the term "Black Market Bread." As I drove down the freeway amongst thousands of other cars I realized that the high price of fuel is an inconvenience
for many of us here in the United States but it can mean starvation for those who already have limited access to resources.
