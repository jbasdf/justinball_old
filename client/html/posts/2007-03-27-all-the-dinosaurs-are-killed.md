The other night I am trying to get Jenna to go to bed which is not easy to do. I almost get here there when she sits up and says, "Dad I want to tell you something." I say, "OK". She says, "all the t-rexs are killed." Then she says, "a meteor came and killed all the good dinosaurs food. All the dinosaurs are killed and they aren't coming back."

After that she went to sleep so I guess I can't complain.
