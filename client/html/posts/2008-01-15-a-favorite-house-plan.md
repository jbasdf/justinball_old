I am one of the owner's of [ThePlanCollection.com an online home plan publisher][1]. When you write all the code that powers a site like that you become very familiar with the product. [This is one of my favorite house plans of all time.][2] It's not huge, but it isn't small either. I think the style is classic. Maybe it is the picture that I love, but I really wish more homes were built with this sort of timeless style.
