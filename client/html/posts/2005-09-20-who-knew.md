I grew up in Idaho.  It is a great place, really.  There are
LOTs of places to visit where for and entire day you can wander through
the wilderness and not see another soul.  It is great.  Then
there are those who have spent to much time wandering around by
themselves.  Here is the scoop from the tv weatherman in
Pocatello.  You read it here.  [The Japanese Mafia is controlling the weather][1].
