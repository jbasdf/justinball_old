I keep trying to setup new websites because I like to pollute the internet.  Ok not really, but I want to setup another domain on my bluehost account because I can have as many as I like and I figure that the world could use more of my blather.  If you are transferring a domain name or need the EPP code from Godaddy.com for any reason it can be hard to find.

Here's how to do it:
<ol>
  <li>Login to Godaddy</li>
  <li>Go to the domain you want to transfer</li>
  <li>Look for this line:
    <pre>
      **Authorization Code:**
      Send by Email
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Click that and you will get the EPP code via email</li>
  <li>All done</li>
