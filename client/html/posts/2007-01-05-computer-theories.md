I have a degree in electrical engineering so I know a lot about computers so there. Over the past five years I have been formulating my primary theory regarding the fundamental nature of computers.

I post it to the world now because my Mac crashed yesterday.

Here it is:
There are millions of very intelligent educated people in this world who know how to do very complicated things like design bridges and fix cars and build big buildings and so on. You and I know these people. Some of them are old - old used to be 30 but I am 30 now so from now on I define old as older than me. Some of them are young. They all have one thing in common. They own a computer and shouldn't. These are the guys that annoy you when they get a new printer and ask you to come install it. However, those of us who know how to use computers should be very glad that they have computers and try to use them. This is why....

As per my education, my theory of computers is thus:
If the person is not smarter than the computer the computer will pull the knowledge from the person sitting in front of it. This energy is how computers work. They share it with other computers around the world via the internet. This is true. I swear it is. It is the secret that all computer science and electrical engineer people know and have thus far kept from the world. It is a grand conspiracy and now I break the silence and reveal it unto you.

Now back to my Mac crashing. I know why it did and it was about due. It hasn't crashed for a very long time because it has had plenty of energy to use that it pulled from all of the inexperienced people sitting in front of their computers around the world. For a few moments, at that instance in time, somewhere in the world and old guy figured out how to plug in his usb camera, or how to use Word or something. I am not sure what exactly, but for that brief moment he sucked back some of the energy thus causing my Mac to crash.

I'm not to worried. I don't think it will happen again.
