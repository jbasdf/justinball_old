I had always assumed that the potential for default on risky mortgages was a problem, but I didn't realize how far reaching it could become. [Here is an article in the New York Times that explains how bad mortgages can have a dire effect on the global economy][1].

[In case you want more bad news here is another report on what is going on in the housing sector][2].

With [ThePlanCollection.com ][3]we are able to observe the market somewhat because many people buy a [house plan][4] before they build a home. In some states things are still moving along and people are still building homes. It will be interesting to watch which styles of house plans continue to sell. Even in hard economic times [luxury house plans][5] tend to remain popular. Interesting.
