I made cashew chicken for dinner tonight. It has peas in it. As is typical of any dinner that doesn't consist of corn dogs or chicken nuggets, Alyssa complained and didn't eat anything. The other girls finished the food we gave them and got cup cakes as a reward. Alyssa complained about that too, but still sat staring at her food (four peas, a couple of carrots and a piece of chicken).

We cleaned up and she still sat there. Finally, as we were putting the dishes away she tells me that "she ate half a pea and didn't like it!"

She actually went to the effort of biting half a pea so she could tell us how gross dinner was.

She didn't get a cupcake.
