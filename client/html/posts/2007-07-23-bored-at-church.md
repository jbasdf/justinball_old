Yesterday, my daughter, out of the blue, told her sunday school teacher, "I'm so bored I could fall asleep." We told her that she shouldn't say things like that to her teachers - she is going to kindergarten in the fall so we need to teach her stuff like that.

The irony is she didn't fall asleep. Instead of saying it, I just fall asleep. I don't remember the last time I made it through sunday school.

You have to love the hypocrisy of parenthood.
