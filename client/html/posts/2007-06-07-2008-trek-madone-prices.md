As a follow up to [my 2008 Trek Madone post][3] I have some prices.

I am sure the price will vary from shop to shop, but here's what I found out:
Pro Series
6.9 $8399
6.5 $5829
5.5 $4180

Performance Series
6.9 $7700
6.5 $5830
5.5 $4180
5.2 $3520

A couple of the Trek shops might have a couple of these bikes in stock, but from the people I have talked to don't expect to see the bikes enmass until the August-October time frame.
