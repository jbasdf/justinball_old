John Battelle “How has the world changed and how is it going a year after the memo from Bill Gates?”

Ray – It is going very well. Some people get it some don’t. Vista and Office are done – released to manufacturing. Should be out to business by the end of November. Vista should be more secure, prevent trojans, phishing etc.

There is still a need for desktop software. The web isn’t always there. Sometimes the pipe isn’t big enough.

I have heard about Ray Ozzie. He is supposed to be a big deal, but I didn't get much out of what he had to say and in fact it felt to me like he had turned into a Microsoft Apologist. I guess that makes sense since he is chief software architect at Microsoft. He is an admirable man with many accomplishments so perhaps he will be the one to lead Microsoft to its next version.
