My deepest sympathy goes out to all those who don't make their home in Logan Utah. There are few places that offer as much in the way of the outdoors as here. This past weekend we spent out time at Bear Lake about an hour away. It is a rather large body of water which was filled with us and a waverunner and my daughters screaming at the top of their lungs, "go faster daddy."

On the way back we drove up to Tony's Grove. It is a small lake in the top of the mountains. The narrow windy road looks like something out of the Tour De France and is a favorite for roadies especially for time trials.

This morning on my way into work (on my bike) we took a detour and road the river trail up the canyon. It is a fun little mtb trail that follows the Logan River. It is also about 3 minutes from my office.

For all those who sit in their cars burning the remains of long gone vegetation and dinosaurs my deepest sympathy.
