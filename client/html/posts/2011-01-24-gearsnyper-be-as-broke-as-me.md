I love to ride and I have a serious addiction to the gear that I use when I ride. It's a nasty combination that frequently results in diarrhea of the wallet. Since I've yet to find a cure I figured that if you're going to do something you should go all the way. Keeping windows open to [BonkTown][1], [ChainLove][2] and [SteepAndCheap][3] all day was killing my productivity so as a true geek I'm going all the way - I wrote some code.

For all my friends that really need a new pair of stretchy pants enjoy my sexy cycling/shopping/technology lovechild for Chrome - GearSnyper:


Click on the logo to install and it will attack you with a joyful barrage of every deal from every site. If you're not man enough for that you can click on the icon and turn off "Show me Everything" and instead enter specific search terms. [GearSnyper][5] won't bother you until it finds a match. Just think, with all the time you save you can actually go outside.
