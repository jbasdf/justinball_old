I have been writing quite a bit lately about open Social Networks and the infrastructure that I think will emerge from WordPress to help fill that niche. Then David sends me to [Ringside Networks][1]. Although new, this projects appears to be a fairly robust piece of software that can integrate with your existing website and add social networking. One of biggest selling points is that the platform will run Facebook applications. Very cool.
