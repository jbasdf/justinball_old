I don't drink very much soda. It isn't healthy and I would rather eat the calories in the form of chocolate. Occasionally, I do drink a bit, but after [reading about how the sodium benzoate in soda destroys the mitoconhdria in your cells, and may "lead to cirrhosis of the liver and degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's," I am pretty sure I will never drink the stuff again][1].
