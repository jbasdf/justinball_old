Korean social site. Combination of popular internet activities – blogs, photo, video sharing.
Here are some statistics:
20 million subscribers
40% of population
96% of 20-29 year olds use regularly
20 billion page views per month

They are coming to the Unites States. It will be interesting to see if Cyworld is successful. Their design and timing fit well with the Korean market, but many of the components already have successful counterparts in the US – flickr, youtube, myspace etc. In addition, the design is very Asian which may or may not resonate in the American market. Culture is important to web design and simply translating content is proving to be insufficient for success. I imagine that is why Jack Ma is successful in China where US companies have failed. It also makes me wonder if there is application for open content.
