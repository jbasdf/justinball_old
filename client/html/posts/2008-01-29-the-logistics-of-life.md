I stopped to get gas this morning, nearly froze and spent $92 for 30 gallons of gas. My truck isn't big, but it drinks a lot and it has two tanks.I only drive it about 12 miles a day so it isn't so bad. I fill up less than once a month and in warmer months I ride my bike and the truck sits in the garage.

I recently got the oil changed as well.

Life is full of little things like that that require our attention, but don't contribute meaningfully to where we want to be. Think about all the logistics we deal with - laundry, taking out the trash, washing cars, email etc. Life is filled with these nagging little things.

I think the trick is to reduce the items that are unnecessary. Believe it or not you can ignore many of the less important items and focus on the important things in life - the things that contribute to full filling goals and achieving success. Do the things that you have to do but don't make them your focus.

We are addicted to email, and feel compelled to read each and every message. Treat it like an answering machine and ignore the ones that aren't really that important and you will find hours added onto your day.

Instead of letting logistics become a destination make them a side trip. Don't plan your day around getting the oil changed or buying groceries. Instead make them a side trip on the way to/from work. Focus on the things that are most important whether that be playing with your kids, getting real work done, or posting to your blog.
