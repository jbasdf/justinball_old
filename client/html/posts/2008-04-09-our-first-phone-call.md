My daughters are in kindergarten this year. Today we got our first call from their teacher. Apparently, Aubrey pinched someone. Callie said that Aubrey realized when her teacher called and ran and hid under the bed. I guess she had to 'pull a card' at school which is a lot like being sentenced to 15 to 20. 

I asked her what she did wrong and she wouldn't answer. Then I said that instead of pinching perhaps we need to enroll her in karate so that she can learn to fight properly. I don't think Callie was amused.
