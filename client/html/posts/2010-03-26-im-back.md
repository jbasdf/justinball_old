The blog has been down for a few days. Once or twice a year I like to give my technology a break. Let the electrons spin free for a while that sort of thing.

I thought I would move the blog from bluehost to webbynode and so I've spent the past few days trying to do just that. I had high hopes for using webbynode as a low cost host where I could put my blog and then stage a Rails site or run a few experiments. After several tries rebuilding the server and trying different deploys I gave up and now I'm back to my old account.

I still think Webbynode is a great service. They make putting up a Rails app a trivial process. I don't think that running a php app (WordPress in my case) next to your Rails app is very good idea unless you move up to the larger plans which means spending a lot of money just to run a blog. If you're going to end up paying that much more you may as well keep a basic account for the blog and run a separate account for your Rails experiments.

Anyway, electron vacation is over and the site's back up. I know you missed me.
