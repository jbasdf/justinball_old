We're home from my parents which in a way marks the end of the Christmas celebration for us. Although, I am pushing for a return of the Twelve days of Christmas which doesn't end until January 5.

Here's what I got for Christmas this year:

A chance to play Santa Claus with the most beautiful Misses Claus in the world until 3 am. I'm glad she wraps the presents and puts everything together while I eat the cookies.

A few (short) moments of watching my children excitedly rip through presents during the few years that they still feel the magic of Christmas.

A few days away from my computer and from code. I love my job but sometimes I forget what it's like to be a normal human being.

One Lego train from a beautiful Misses Claus and an hour to put it together with my brother. I'm getting old but it is nice to remember what Christmas was like when you were ten.

2 loaves of my grandmother's bread.

A couple of days with family.

A couple of days to go home and recover from family.

An awesome Christmas card from Zach Poulter.

A couple of hours with friends that I haven't seen in many years.
