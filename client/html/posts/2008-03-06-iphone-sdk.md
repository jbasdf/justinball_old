[Apple finally introduced the iPhone SDK today][1]. [The capabilities of the phone are amazing and this opens up an even greater world][2]. I am lusting after a terminal on mine so that I can get into my server from anywhere. There are so many things going on right now it is a great time to be a programmer.

Oh, and there is that iFund thing too with $100 million available for iPhone developers.
